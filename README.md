# IsometricRPG

We got an assignment from our university lecturer Christian Auby to develop an application of our own choosing. The main goal of this assignment was for everybody to learn more about programming in a team and for us to understand more about C++ and how to develop graphical interfaces. For our final DAT220 assignment we chose to make an isometric role-playing game. The game is made using the programming language C++. We have also used several libraries, such as SFMl for graphics, Anax for entity system and JasonCPP to parse Json.
